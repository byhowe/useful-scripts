# useful-scripts

A set of scripts I use to manage my system.

- ## [persona](https://github.com/byhowe/useful-scripts/tree/development/persona)
  Clone all of your github repositories to change the committer names and email
  addresses accross all commits. Replace text that might include sensitive
  information. Push all the changes back to upstream.
- ## [memory](https://github.com/byhowe/useful-scripts/tree/development/memory)
  Generate thumbnails from .JPG and .CR2 files. Useful when the original files
  are too large to be retrieved from the source.
